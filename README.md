## Concept
An immersive artistic activity is proposed in which the public can experience being part of the performance, through the movement of the participants, which will be sensed and processed live and transformed into visual and musical expressions. The idea of the experience will be to reflect on how collective artistic creation can be enhanced with the use of IoT, machine learning and artificial intelligence devices and with the participation in communities.
